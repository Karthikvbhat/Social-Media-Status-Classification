Social Media Status Classification, in the era of abundant digital communication, social
media platforms have become indispensable sources of information and personal
expression. One of the most prevalent forms of user-generated content on these platforms
is status updates, reflecting users' thoughts, sentiments, and activities. Analyzing and
classifying such status updates can offer valuable insights into user behavior, trends, and
sentiment patterns.
This project aims to delve into the world of social media status classification using
advanced machine learning techniques. The primary focus is on a dataset obtained from
Kaggle, specifically the 'live.csv' dataset containing Facebook status updates. The goal is
to develop a robust classification model that accurately categorizes status updates based
on their content.
